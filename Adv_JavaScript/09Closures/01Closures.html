    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In
      other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from
      an inner function.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Function Bundled together with its lexical Environment makes a Closure.

        <b>lexical environment =></b>
      A lexical environment in JavaScript is a data structure that stores the
      variables and functions that are defined in the current scope and all of
      the outer scopes. It is also known as the lexical scope or the lexical
      closure

      function Outerouter(params) {
        let b = 20;
        function outer() {
          let a = 10;
          console.log(b);
          function inner() {
            console.log(a);
          }
          inner();
